\title{Simulated Affymetrix(TM) Oligonucleotide Array Experiment Data}
\description{
  The package \code{SharedHT2} contains one dataset \code{SimAffyDat} 
  for testing purposes.  The dataframe has 12625 rows and 6 columns.
  The rows are named after the hgu95 affy gene identifiers in order
  that the links to the GeneCard database work. The six column variables
  represent hypothetical base two logged expression ratios for 
  three replicates of treatment 1 versus control and treatment 2 
  versus control.  
}
\usage{
 data(SimAfyDat)
}
\note{
  All but the first 100 rows have population mean zero.
  The first 100 rows have group specific population means equal to 
  $7.5/3^0.5$ times the square root of the averaged sample variances across 
  genes. Strikingly, eye inspection of the dataset (compare the first 100
  rows to the rows which follow) reveals positive and negative numbers among
  observations representing all but the first 100 rows. However, all tests
  except the emprical Bayes Hotelling T-squared tests are unable to correctly
  identify these "genes" without high false positive rates.  The sampling
  distribution used in the simulation is the Wishart/Inverse Wishart model.
  See the manuscript "sharedHT2.pdf" in the ./doc directory.
